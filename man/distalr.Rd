\title{Emulate DisTal in R}
\usage{
distalr(taleParts, repeats.cluster.h.cut = 10, ncores = ncores)
}
\arguments{
\item{taleParts}{a table of TALE parts as returned by the \code{\link[tantale:getTaleParts]{getTaleParts}} function.}

\item{repeats.cluster.h.cut}{numeric value to cut the hierachycal clustering tree of the repeat.}
}
\value{
A list with DisTal output components: 
\itemize{
  \item repeats.code: a data frame of the unique repeat AA sequences and their numeric codes
  \item coded.repeats.str: a list of repeat-coded TALE strings
  \item repeat.similarity:  a long, three columns data frame with pairwise similarity scores between repeats
  \item tal.similarity: a three columns Tals similarity table with pairwise similarity scores between TALEs
  \item tree: Newick format neighbor-joining tree of TALs constructed based on TALEs similarity
  \item repeats.cluster: a data frame containing repeat code and repeat clusters.
}
}
\description{
This is meant to approximate the results of DisTal in R and is very similar to
\code{\link[tantale:runDistal]{runDistal}}.
It still uses the Arlem binary just like DisTal but performs the rest of the operations
with R support. Even with parallel computing it is slower than the original perl code...
Computational bottleneck occurs probably at the stage where repeat amino acid sequences are
systematically pairwise aligned.
