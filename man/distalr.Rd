\title{Emulate DisTal in R}
\usage{
distalr(
  taleParts,
  repeats.cluster.h.cut = 10,
  ncores = 1,
  pairwiseAlnMethod = "DECIPHER",
  condaBinPath = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taleParts}{a table of TALE parts as returned by the \code{\link[tantale:getTaleParts]{getTaleParts}} function.}

\item{repeats.cluster.h.cut}{numeric value to cut the hierarchical clustering tree of the repeat.}

\item{pairwiseAlnMethod}{Specify the underlying approach for computing pairwise similarities between
TALE parts amino acid sequences. Must be "Biostrings", "mmseq2" or "DECIPHER"}

\item{condaBinPath}{Path to your Conda binary file if you need to specify a
path different from the one that is automatically searched by the
reticulate package functions.}
}
\value{
A list with DisTal output components: 
\itemize{
  \item taleParts: the original input tibble with a 'domCode' column corresponding to the unique distal
   'code' or label attached to a unique domain sequence. Thus all parts with this sequence will have the same
   'domCode'.
  \item repeats.code: a data frame of the unique repeat AA sequences and their numeric codes
  \item coded.repeats.str: a list of repeat-coded TALE strings
  \item repeat.similarity:  a long, three columns data frame with pairwise similarity scores between repeats
  \item tal.similarity: a three columns Tals similarity table with pairwise similarity scores between TALEs
  \item repeats.cluster: a data frame containing repeat code and repeat clusters.
}
}
\description{
This is meant to approximate the results of DisTal in R and is very similar to
\code{\link[tantale:runDistal]{runDistal}}.
It still uses the Arlem binary just like DisTal but performs the rest of the operations
with R support and parallelization. Depending on the \code{pairwiseAlnMethod} parameter value it is 
much faster than the orginial Perl code and returns similar results. Please take a look at the vignette for
tips on how to use it properly.
