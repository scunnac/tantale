\title{'Nice' plotting a multiple alignment of TALE sequences}
\usage{
ggplotTalesMsa(
  repeatAlign,
  talsim = NULL,
  rvdAlign = NULL,
  repeatSim = NULL,
  repeat.clust.h.cut = 90,
  refgrep = NULL,
  consensusSeq = FALSE,
  fillType = "repeatClust"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{repeatAlign}{A multiple Tal repeat sequences alignment in the form of a
matrix as returned by \code{\link[tantale:buildRepeatMsa]{buildRepeatMsa}}
or as one of the elements of the \code{SeqOfRepsAlignments} slot in the
return object of the \code{\link{buildDisTalGroups}} function.}

\item{talsim}{a \emph{three columns Tals similarity table} as obtained with
\code{\link[tantale:runDistal]{runDistal}} in the 'tal.similarity' slot of
the returned object.}

\item{rvdAlign}{A multiple Tal RVD sequences alignment in the form of a
matrix as returned by \code{\link[tantale:convertRepeat2RvdAlign]{convertRepeat2RvdAlign}}, 
 \code{\link[tantale:buildRepeatMsa]{buildRepeatMsa}} 
or as one of the elements of the \code{SeqOfRepsAlignments} slot in the
return object of the \code{\link{buildDisTalGroups}} function.}

\item{repeatSim}{A long, three columns data frame with pairwise similarity
scores between repeats as available in the \code{repeat.similarity slot} of
the object returned by the \code{\link[tantale:runDistal]{runDistal}} or the 
the \code{\link[tantale:distalr]{distalr}} functions.}

\item{repeat.clust.h.cut}{height for tree cutting when defining domain/repeat
clusters.}

\item{refgrep}{Regular expression pattern that will be used to search TALE
names to select the reference in the alignment.}

\item{consensusSeq}{(logical) Whether to display the consensus sequence
**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**}

\item{fillType}{Either "repeatClust" or "repeatSim". If both options are
possible because the necessary information is there (at least a
\code{repeatSim} value), this argument will decide what type of 'box color
filling' is employed and it is either based on the cluster where the repeat
falls after clustering all the repeat in the alignment or it is based on
the amino acid similarity between a repeat at a position and the repeat of
the 'reference' TALE at this position.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link[aplot:insert_left]{aplot}} object.
}
\description{
Plot TALEs msa in the ggplot2 framework.
}
\details{
This function as a similar purpose as
\code{\link[tantale:heatmap_msa]{heatmap_msa}} but has been implemented with
\code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot}}. It is more versatile (takes single row
matrices of alignment) but a bit slower.

The type of plot that you will get will depend on the provided information in
the form of parameter values See the tantale website for detailed usage
cases.

The only mandatory argument is either \code{repeatAlign} \strong{or}
\code{rvdAlign}.

The plot is printed and returned for further modifications is necessary.
