\title{Run TALE target predictions on DNA sequence(s) using Talvez}
\usage{
talvez(
  rvdSeqs,
  subjDnaSeqFile,
  optParam = "-t 0 -l 19",
  outDir = NULL,
  talvezDir = system.file("tools", "TALVEZ_3.2", package = "tantale", mustWork = T),
  condaBinPath = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rvdSeqs}{Tale RVD sequences are supplied as either a fasta file (atomic
character vector) with Tale info (name) in title and sequences of RVD as a
space or '-' separeted string or as a Biostrings XStringSet with sequences
of RVD similarly formated.}

\item{subjDnaSeqFile}{Expects a character vector specifying the path to the
fasta file holding subject DNA sequence(s). Talvez forbids to have
sequences in the file wrapped at a fixed width. The function uses
Biostrings to unwrap them but if you use subject sequences longer than
20kb, this will fail and you are advised to unwrap your sequences before
hand.}

\item{optParam}{An atomic character vector specifying optionnal parameters
for the Talvez script (eg "-t 0 -l 19"). \strong{These may not include} the
'-e' and '-z' options specifying the matrix files.}

\item{outDir}{Expects a character vector specifying the path to an output
directory. If not supplied, output files will be temporary.}

\item{talvezDir}{If you want to use another version of Talvez than the one
supplied with tantale, specify the path of the directory containing the
necessary files here.}

\item{condaBinPath}{Path to your Conda binary file if you need to specify
a path different from the one that is automatically searched by the
reticulate package functions.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the EBE predictions. \strong{Note that column names
  have been modified} relative to the column names found in the originale
  programs's output in order to homogenize column names across TALE target
  prediction programs in tantale.
}
\description{
A R wrapper around the
\href{https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068464}{Talvez} predictor perl
script. Takes a list of TALE RVD sequences and a fasta file of DNA sequences
and runs Talvez
}
\details{
Note that this talvez wrapper, uses the RVD - Nucleotide specificity matrices
used with talvez, it is not possible to use custom ones.
Note also that the talvez script is run in a conda environment providing the
necessary dependencies. This environment will be created automatically if
necessary.
