\arguments{
\item{subjectFile}{Fasta file with DNA sequence(s) to be searched for the
presence of TALE coding sequences (CDS).}

\item{outputDir}{Path of the output directory. If not specified, resluts will
be written to working folder.}

\item{hmmFilesDir}{Specify the path to a folder holding the hmmfiles if you
do not want to use the ones provided with tantale.}

\item{minRatioOfGapForColMasking}{Columns of the tale repeat CDS alignment
that contain a gap in a fraction of sequence higher than this value (betwen
0 and 1) will be masked from the alignment when translating the DNA
sequences to protein.}

\item{TALE_NtermDNAHitMinScore}{Minimal nhmmer score cut_off value to
consider the hit as genuine}

\item{repeatDNAHitMinScore}{Minimal nhmmer score cut_off value to consider
the hit as genuine}

\item{TALE_CtermDNAHitMinScore}{Minimal nhmmer score cut_off value to
consider the hit as genuine}

\item{minDomainHitsPerSubjSeq}{Minimum number of nhmmer hits for a subject
sequence to be reported as having TALE diagnostic regions. This is a way to
simplify output a little by getting ride of uninformative sequences}

\item{mergeHits}{Perform overlapping hits merging per domain type.}

\item{minGapWidth}{Minimum gap in base pairs between two tale domain hits for
them to be considered distinct. If the length of the gap is below this
value, domains are considered "contiguous" and grouped in the same array.}

\item{minDomainHitsPerArrayForAssembl}{DEPRECATED argument. Used to speficy
the Minimum number of repeat in an array for its seq of RVD to be
considered for assembly. This is a way to get ride of sequences that are
too short reasonably be of any help for assembly}

\item{taleArrayStartAnchorCode}{This scalar character vector will symbolize a
TALE N-TERM CDS hit in the RVD sequence}

\item{taleArrayEndAnchorCode}{This scalar character vector will symbolize a
TALE C-TERM CDS hit in the RVD sequence}

\item{appendExtremityCodes}{Set this to \code{FALSE} if you do not want the N- and C-TREM anchor codes in the output sequences of RVD}

\item{rvdSep}{Symbol acting as a separator in RVD sequences}

\item{hmmerpath}{Specify the path to a directory holding the HMMER
executable if you do not want to use the ones provided with tantale.}

\item{extendedLength}{number of nucleotides to extend in 3'-end}

\item{talArrayCorrection}{True or False}

\item{refForTalArrayCorrection}{reference AA sequences for tal array correction}

\item{frameShiftCorrection}{default = 11}

\item{...}{\code{\link[DECIPHER:CorrectFrameshifts]{CorrectFrameshifts}}}
}
\value{
This functions has only side effects (writing files, mostly).
  However, if everything ran smoothly, it will invisibly return the path of
  the directory where output files were written.
  In the arrayReport.tsv, column \emph{predicted_dels_count}/\emph{predicted_ins_count} shows the number of putative deletions/insertions in the raw sequences that have been corrected in the corrected sequences by deletion/insertion with the function \code{\link[DECIPHER:CorrectFrameshifts]{CorrectFrameshifts}}.
}
\description{
\code{tellTale} has been primarily written to report on 'corrected' TALE RVD
sequences in noisy DNA sequences (suboptimally polished genomes assembly, raw
reads of long read sequencing technologies [eg PacBio, ONT]) that would
otherwise be missed by conventional tools (eg AnnoTALE).
}
\details{
It works but is far from optimal for 'corrected' repeat CDS and  \strong{it
currently tends to remove 'unconventional' portions of repeat CDS}. This may
be problematic for downstream analysis with DisTAL, especially for 'aberrant'
repeats.

N- and C-terminal domains CDS are not currently 'corrected'.

It will work also if the subject DNA sequences are of high quality
\strong{but may 'correct' genuine frame shifts in TALE repeat array CDS}.

Will output a number of files including tabular reports on the TALE arrays
(ie full length or partial tal gene CDS) and on the identified coding
sequences for TALE domains, including repeat CDS.
