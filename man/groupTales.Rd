\usage{
groupTales(
  taleSim,
  plotTree = FALSE,
  k = NULL,
  k_test = NULL,
  method = "k-medoids"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taleSim}{a \emph{three columns Tals similarity table} as obtained with \code{\link[tantale:runDistal]{runDistal}} in the 'tal.similarity' slot of the returned object.}

\item{plotTree}{logical indicating whether to plot hclust tree or not. If the method is "k-medoids", no tree will be plotted (but instead, a plot of silhoutte value).}

\item{k}{integer indicating number of groups you want Tals to be classified. Or only in case that method is "k-medoids", k = "auto" to automatically pick the optimum k or k = NULL to interactively pick it. Do not always trust the automatic picking, it is better to choose k interactively or test with different values.}

\item{k_test}{integer vector of 2 indicating the range of k to test, only available when method = "k-medoids". Note that the minimum value for k is 2.}

\item{method}{one of two methods: "hclust" (see \code{\link[stats:cutree]{cutree}}) and "k-medoids" (see \code{\link[cluster:pam]{pam}}).}
}
\value{
a data frame containing name of tals from taleSim and their classified groups.
}
\description{
Classifying Tal groups by hierchical clustering or by k-medoids clustering based on their similarity.
